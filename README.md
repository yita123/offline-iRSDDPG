This is our first attempt at applying reinforcement learning to decision-making in the blast furnace ironmaking process. We would like to thank all our friends for sharing a wealth of information on the internet. Your help is the foundation of our work. If you find our work inspiring or use any of the code mentioned above in your research, please cite our paper.
